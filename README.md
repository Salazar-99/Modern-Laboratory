# Modern-Laboratory
This is a collection of data analysis scripts and reports written during the Modern Laboratory (PHY353L) course at The University of Texas at Austin. 
Some of the reports yielded null results due to the time constraints. I took this course over the summer and had one week to complete the experiment,
perform the analysis, and write the report. Nonetheless, I hope this may serve future students taking the course in structuring their reports and hopefully avoiding
any pitfalls notiecable in my reports.
